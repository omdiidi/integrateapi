      solution: [
        "We built a custom back-end inventory system designed specifically for vinyl stores.",
        "Each record is QR-labeled and tied to a single inventory record. When a vinyl is listed or sold, inventory updates everywhere automatically - including marketplaces like eBay, Amazon, and Discogs. If it sells in one place, it is removed everywhere else. No double entry. No overselling.",
        "We also built a simple internal UI so staff can add records in seconds, even with minimal tech experience.",
        "On top of that, we added a private inventory network. Stores can selectively share inventory and wholesale records directly between each other when sourcing rare pressings.",
