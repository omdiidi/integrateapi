Prompt

Build a production-ready, modern marketing website for my consulting and integrations automation business named IntegrateAPI.

Core goal
Communicate instantly: IntegrateAPI replaces manual work with simple digital systems that teams actually use. We modernize small local businesses with messy operations, paper-based tracking, and disconnected tools - without forcing them to change how they truly run the business. The vibe is calm, confident, practical, operator-led.

High-level visual direction
Create a premium, high-contrast, tech-forward landing experience with:

A bold hero with a soft multi-color gradient background and a diagonal/angled transition into a clean white content area

Subtle background grid lines and dotted guides (very light) across light sections

Large editorial typography, lots of whitespace, crisp alignment

Pill-shaped buttons and chips, clean borders, soft shadows

“Floating UI” mock cards built with HTML/CSS (no external images). Use simple SVG charts, blocks, and lines to imply dashboards and workflows.

Important constraint

Do NOT use any third-party brand names, product names, or copy from other companies

Do NOT use images. All visuals must be made from CSS + SVG + simple shapes and mock UI cards.

Tech requirements

Next.js (App Router) + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS

Clean component structure: Container, Section, SectionHeading, Button, Card, Nav, Footer, LogoWall, FeatureSplit, StatsBand, CarouselCards

Accessibility: semantic HTML, correct heading order, keyboard navigation, visible focus, aria labels

SEO: per-page title/description, OpenGraph, sitemap, robots

Performance: minimal dependencies, prefer CSS + small helpers, avoid heavy animation libraries

Contact form with validation and success state. Use an API route that logs submissions server-side as a starter (or use an env var placeholder for form action).

Site structure
Build a small multi-page site with clear navigation:

Home

Services

How It Works

Use Cases

About

Contact

Global navigation

Left: IntegrateAPI wordmark (text logo)

Right: links to pages

Primary CTA button: “Book a quick systems audit”

Secondary link: “Contact”

On the hero section, nav sits over the gradient background and stays readable.

Homepage sections and layout style

Hero (premium gradient + floating UI cards)

Left: giant headline (2 lines), short supporting paragraph, email capture or simple CTA row

Right: layered mock UI cards (no images) - one “dashboard” card with a tiny SVG line chart, one “workflow” card with steps, one “mobile” card shape - with soft shadows and slight blur behind

Add a small announcement pill above the headline (generic, not referencing other brands) like “Now taking new projects - Q1 openings”

Primary CTA: Book a quick systems audit

Secondary CTA link: See use cases

Logo wall (text-only)

A row/grid of 8-12 neutral “client-style” text logos like: Northside Dental, Elmwood Auto, Lakeshore HVAC, Riverbend Logistics, etc (fictional).

Light separators and lots of whitespace.

Modular solutions section (light gray background + subtle grid)

Left: small eyebrow label in accent color, big headline, short paragraph

Right: a network of small icon tiles (SVG line icons) with one highlighted tile and thin connector lines (SVG) to imply “connected tools”

CTA button styled as a rounded pill with arrow.

Repeating feature split sections (3 sections)
Each section follows the same pattern:

Left: small icon + label, large heading, short paragraph, pill CTA, and a “See also” list of 3 internal links

Right: a big floating mock “product UI” panel (built from divs) that looks like a dashboard/pricing/table/form. No images - just clean UI blocks, subtle borders, and tiny SVG sparklines.
The three feature themes should map to IntegrateAPI:

Workflow digitization - replace paper and retyping

Tool integrations - connect POS, scheduling, CRM, invoicing, spreadsheets, email

Operational dashboards - visibility without busywork

Dark “scale and reliability” section

Full-width dark navy background

Left: eyebrow label, big white headline, short paragraph

Right: an abstract dotted “globe” made as an SVG dot matrix or pattern (no images), plus 2-3 curved arc lines with small nodes to imply movement

Bottom: a 4-column stats band with realistic but non-specific stats (avoid anything that sounds like a copied claim). Example style: “Hours saved weekly”, “Fewer handoffs”, “Faster turnaround”, “Cleaner data”. Use concise supporting text.

Card carousel section

Heading + short description + left/right arrow buttons

Large cards with a thin top accent bar, soft shadow, and lots of padding

Each card represents a business type you serve (fictional examples): Clinic, Contractor, Retail, Logistics, Property services, etc

Cards include: title, 2-3 sentence description, “Learn more” link, and a bottom row of tiny text “tool icons” as words (ex: Scheduling, Payments, CRM) - no images.

Final CTA band

Clean white section with one strong line and a short supporting sentence

Button: Book a quick systems audit

Secondary: Email link

Footer
Minimal, with:

One-sentence mission line

Contact email and service area line (generic)

Page links

Copyright

Design tokens

Typography: Inter (or similar) with system fallback. Large bold headlines, clean hierarchy.

Colors:

Base background: white and very light gray sections

Accent: #5E84EF for links, small labels, thin bars, buttons

Add a soft hero gradient (tasteful) and a dark navy section for contrast

Components: pill buttons, thin borders, subtle shadows, rounded corners.

Motion and interaction requirements (no heavy libs)
Use CSS + small IntersectionObserver helpers:

Hero background gradient subtly shifts position (very slow)

Floating UI cards gently drift up/down (very subtle)

Scroll reveal: fade + slight translate for sections

Buttons: hover glow + tiny lift, active press down

Optional: primary CTA has a very subtle pulse/breathing animation until hovered

Card hover: lift + shadow increase

Carousel: smooth scroll with snap and arrow controls

Copywriting rules

Calm, practical, operator voice. No hype, no buzzwords.

Short paragraphs, scannable bullets.

Be specific about outcomes: fewer handoffs, fewer errors, faster turnaround, cleaner tracking, less retyping.

Avoid vague phrasing like “we leverage”. Use direct statements like “We connect your tools so data moves automatically.”

Write all copy for every page and make it coherent and consistent.
